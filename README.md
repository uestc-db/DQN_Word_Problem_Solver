####Requirements:

- Tensorflow 1.2.1
- Python 2.7

####Introduction

The research paper [MathDQN: Solving Arithmetic Word Problems via Deep Reinforcement Learning]() has been accepted at the Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-18).

To run the experiment with default parameters:

```
    python DQN.py 0(fold number)
```

Now, we only provide code for dataset AI2.(code for other two datasets will be integrated in this code soon)
